If you encounter any issues or need clarification on any of the requirements, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly.\n\nThis is a high priority item, and I appreciate your cooperation in meeting this tight deadline.

Previously, employees could carry over a maximum of 5 days. Under the new policy, you will be able to carry over up to 10 days of unused annual leave.\n\nAdditionally, we are introducing a new use-it-or-lose-it deadline of March 31st for any carried-over days, giving you ample time to utilize your accrued leave in the new year.\n\nPlease review the attached document for complete details, including special provisions for employees on long-term projects and those returning from extended leave. If you have any questions or concerns about how these changes affect your particular situation, please contact the HR department.\n\nWe believe these changes will provide greater flexibility while still encouraging employees to take adequate time off for rest and rejuvenation.\n\nWarm regards,\nHuman Resources Department",

However, I'd really appreciate a thorough review, especially of the security aspects and the error handling logic.\n\nCould someone please review the PR by tomorrow morning? We need to merge this before the feature freeze on Wednesday if we want it included in the next release.\n\nThe PR is #247 in our repository. I've added inline comments on the sections that I think might need extra attention.\n\nThanks in advance for your time!\n\nCharlie",
